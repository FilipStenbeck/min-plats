This is a small web application targeting mobile devices. I made it while trying out CoffeScript & Backbone.
The app displays live information of bus departures for a few selected bus stops. Very useful (if you live near me). There is also a basic search page which make it possible to get information from other busstops in the Stockholm area

The backend is written in Node and I use the API from trafiklab.se to get the data.
